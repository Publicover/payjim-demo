invoice#index(@user) kind of a little blurb about why you created it
  'this software created by jim to solve need for whatever, if you want to liscence it or whatever'
login
  'contact me for a demo login if you're interested in the software'

nice buttons: (print and login page)
  rounded corners (not circle button round square)
  nice color with nice font (use maybe gray from nav maybe two or three shades lighter)
    white san-serif font
  proportionatly scaled
  a lot of breathing room
make print invoice a button

not dash creative call it like pay jim or something
'put another link up there that's like hire jim or something that goes to another work page'
large button bold font keep it all lowercase
'dash billing' in navbar shouldn't be dark, bold links, make all upper or all lower
invoice#index intro text: redo it (don't use 'should')

invoice#index: change date worked to due date (which doesn't exist in the db yet)
